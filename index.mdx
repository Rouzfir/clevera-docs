title: "What Clevera does anyway "
description: "Clevera is an AI how-to video creator that takes a normal screen recording and turns it into a polished, narrated tutorial or product demo, automatically. You don’t need to speak while recording (it’s optional), and you don’t need to be a video editor or a voice actor. Clevera analyzes what happened on screen, writes a voiceover script, picks a synthetic voice, times everything, and gives you an editor to make quick tweaks."

### **What you’ll need**

- A Mac or Windows machine
- A Clevera account (log in at [app.clevera.ai](http://app.clevera.ai))

If you talk while recording, Clevera does not use your real voice in the final video. Your speech is only used as context to write a better script. The final narration is generated using a synthetic voice.

<Info>
  When installing Clevera recorder app, it prompts you to grant these permissions:

  - Accessibility permission
  - Input Monitoring permission
  - Screen Recording permission
  - Microphone permission

  Clevera only listens while you’re actively recording. Input Monitoring just captures key logs during a recording session, and it ceases when you stop.

<Tip>
  Tip: If macOS doesn’t show Clevera under Screen Recording permissions, open System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording and enable Clevera, then restart the app.
