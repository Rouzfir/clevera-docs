<Info>
  When installing Clevera recorder app, it prompts you to grant these permissions:

  - Accessibility permission
  - Input Monitoring permission
  - Screen Recording permission
  - Microphone permission

  Clevera only listens while you’re actively recording. Input Monitoring just captures key logs during a recording session, and it ceases when you stop.
</Info>

<Tip>
  Tip: If macOS doesn’t show Clevera under Screen Recording permissions, open System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording and enable Clevera, then restart the app.
